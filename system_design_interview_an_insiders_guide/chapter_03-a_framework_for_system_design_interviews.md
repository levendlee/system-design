# Signals
## Good
- Collaborate
- Work under pressure
- Resolve ambiguity constructively
- Ask good questions

## Bad
- Over-engineering
- Narrow mindedness
- Stubbornness

# 4-Step Process
## 1. Understand the problem and establish the design scope (3-10 mins)
- **Answering without a thorough understanding of the requirement is a huge red flag**
- Ask right questions, make proper assumption, gather all the information needed to build a system, **write them down**.
- Example questions:
  - What features?
  - What volume? How many users?
  - How fast anticipate to scale up?
  - What's the technology stack to leverage?

## 2. Propose high-level design and get buy-in (10-15 mins)
- Develop a high-level design and reach an agreement with the interviewer on the design. Collaborate with the interviewer.
  - Come up with initial blueprint. Ask for feedback.
  - Draw box diagrams with key components on whiteboard/paper.
  - Do back-of-the-envelop calculations to evaluate blueprint can scale. Think out loud.
  - (Optionally) Go through a few concrete use cases.

## 3. Design deep dive (10-25 mins)
At this stage, should have achieved:
  - Agreed on overall goals and feature scope.
  - Sketched out a high-level blueprint for overall design.
  - Obtained feedback from interviewer on high-level design.
  - Had some initial ideas about areas to focus on in deep dive.

## 4. Wrap up (3-5 mins)
Interviewer ask followup questions or discuss additional points.
-  Recap of the design. Especially important if suggested a few solutions.
-  Identify system bottlenecks and discuss potential improvements.
-  Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc).
-  Operation issues. Monitor metrics and error logs. Roll out system.
-  Handle scale curve.
-  Propose other refinements.

# Dos and Don'ts
## Dos
-  Ask for clarification.
-  Understand the requirement. 
  - Fit the scale of the business.
-  Think out loud.
-  Suggest multiple approaches.
-  Go into details after finalize blueprint.
  - Design critical part first.
-  Bounce ideas off the interviewer.

## Don'ts
-  Be unprepared for typical questions.
-  Jump into solution without clarifications.
-  Go into too much details at the beginning.
-  Hesitate to ask for hints if get stuck.
-  Don't think it is done until the interviewer says so.
