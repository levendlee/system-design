# System Design Notes

Notes on system designs. All sorts of system designs bundled with engineering
principles. 

All of these notes should also be available on my [WordPress Site](levenedlee.com)
with additional content written in 2020.

## System Design Interview - An insider's Guide

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=2AR6CLKAY01JI&keywords=system+design+interview&qid=1704522257&sprefix=system+design%2Caps%2C258&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)
- This is a classic book on system design interview. However, I found the notes
are not well structured. No enough bullen points, charts, diagrams to make sure
people understand the whole picture.
- It is designed to be a easy and simple book not covering an in-depth
knowledges on distributed systems.

## Machine-Learning System Design Interview - An insider's Guide

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-System-Design-Interview/dp/1736049127/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TWBU0GOQIG2L&keywords=ml+system+design+interview&qid=1704522477&sprefix=ml+system+design+interview%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-1)
- This is a new book. Compared to the web based book, it is more well
structured and easier to understand the whole picture with the end of chapter
flow chart.
- Still, it is designed to be a easy and simple book not covering an in-depth
knowledges on machine learning.
